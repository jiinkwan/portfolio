    1. [Bligh Tax Prediction Model](https://github.com/jiinkwan/portfolio/blob/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Specialization/Machine%20Learning/Blight%20Tax%20Payment%20Prediction.ipynb)
        - Classification Problem
        - Who unlikely pay their blight tax in Michigan?
        - Algorithm: Random Forest
        - It turns out the most relevant features are fine amount and judgment amount
        - The result indicates that, if we were to encourage people to pay the fine, we might consider giving them discount
    2. Text Mining with NLTK package
        - Topic modeling through document_path_similarity, similarity score, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation
    3. [Social Network Analysis with NetworkX package](https://github.com/jiinkwan/portfolio/blob/master/Applied%20Data%20Science%20Specialization/Social%20Network%20Analysis/Connetion%20Prediction.ipynb)
        - Classification Problem
        - How likely each unconnected node would connect in the future
        - Algorithm: Random Forest
        - Evaluation Methods: Preferential Attachment, Jaccard Coefficient, Resource Allocation Index
        - Used three different method to evaluate the how likely specific edge will be created
